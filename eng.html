      <h3>Predictive Maintenance</h3>
      <p>Topic of my thesis is 'Predictive maintenance system using Python'. So now I am highy interesed in that topic. I tihnk predictive maintenance will be very important in factories in the future. Of course it is not easy to do that kind of system and it isn't cheap but I think it is a good investment for companies. I want to create a future. That's why I learned Python and Sql to do it.  </p>

      <h3>Matlab</h3>
      <p>I use Matlab to see the solution of Predictive Maintenance in Matlabs toolboxes. I also do a simply example of program with Artificial Intelligence. </p>
